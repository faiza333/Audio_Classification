### Bike Sales Analysis
#### Project Description
In this project,I evaluated the bike sales data to understand different factors that are considered by
the customers before making a purchase decision. For implementing this, I created pivot tables in Excel
to understand how different factors such as income, gender, education, marital status, regions, etc. are
correlated to each other. Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
